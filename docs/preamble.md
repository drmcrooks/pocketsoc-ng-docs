# Preamble

- One issue when deploying network monitoring as we have discussed: Volume of information
- Very easy when presented with 10’s of Gbs of data to be overwhelmed 
    - My experience!
    - Wait, I didn’t know that happened, is that normal!? (Probably!)

- Intention of the environment we will use is to create a quiet SOC sandbox based on the principles we have discussed
